This is a Star Trek [LCARS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) themed live wallpaper for Android 2.1+ devices.

What it does/shows:
  * Current CPU utilization
  * Current CPU speed
  * Memory consumption of running services and applications (tap "WARP EF")
  * Power status of phone (tap "WARP EF")
  * System uptime
  * Stardate (ST:TNG format)
  * Two other stats I'll leave open for interpretation
  * Interactive star ship schematics (courtesy L Tanganho)
  * [changelog](changelog.md)

The LCARS design leaves plenty of black space to arrange your icons/widgets. I prefer a 5-row layout (available in some ROMs), but 4 works pretty well. The interface looks best in portrait and switches to a minimalist background in landscape (with no live system stats).

This live wallpaper is designed primarily for portrait-aspect devices.  The current version is extremely boring when used in landscape mode.
